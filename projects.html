							<h3><strong>Adventures Of Blue </strong></h3>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/MainMenu.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p> Adventures Of Blue is a 2D platformer that was developed within a week purely to get experience working with 2D and to set myself a personal challenge of developing a game in 1 week.
								You get to play as the character "Blue" who is trapped in a cave filled with moving platforms, traps and dangerous enemies. You must navigate through each level collecting Gems where you will be rewarded with score points.
								Responsibilities consist of; Core gameplay mechanics, level design, character/enemy design and implementation, scripting and other bonus gameplay mechanics.

								<h3><strong>Follow Object </strong></h3>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/finch.png" width = "250" height = "375" alt="" /></span>
								<p> First year project included object oriented programming with Java and Finch robots. My specific project was to have the robot follow an object if the sensors detected an object infront and tapped once.
								<br>
								<br>
								I had to also ensure that the robot was able to change its colour according to its action and if a possible collision was to occur, the finch would stop and display a red colour.
