								<h3><strong>Forgotten Memories </strong></h3>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/img fm.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Forgotten Memories is a work in progress, however it is a 3D adventure/exploration game that is developed and designed from scratch in Unity Game engine. 
								 The player starts the game off with having recently come out of hospital with memory loss regarding the past, to gather fragments of the past,
								the player would have to experience and find specific objects that could spark regain in memory.</p>

								<h3><strong>Classy Coupons</strong></h3>
								<span class="image left"><img src="images/classy2.png" width = "500" height = "570" alt="" /></span>
								<p>create a software that would provide users with discounts they could find on a single application and filter their searches accordingly without having to exit out of the software to find other discount coupon codes to meet their needs. 
								My contributions to this idea reflected the targeted audience as well as the overall theme.</p>
								<p>I undertook the role of creating/designing the manage listings page which can be found on the business side of the application which is used by merchants. This feature is also followed by having options to edit and delete current listings.

							<h3><strong>Urban Wards </strong></h3>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/level 2.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Urban Wards is a 3D serious hazard perception game developed for my University final year project. The game consists of 3 levels ranging from day time to different urban environments.
								The video game was developed with the target audience in mind which is primarily for Older adults. No prior knowledge of Unity or C# before undertaking project including the writing of the dissertation which all was completed and played-through in 6 months.

								<h3><strong>Follow Object </strong></h3>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/finch.png" width = "250" height = "375" alt="" /></span>
								<p> First year project included object oriented programming with Java and Finch robots. My specific project was to have the robot follow an object if the sensors detected an object infront and tapped once.
								<br>
								<br>
								I had to also ensure that the robot was able to change its colour according to its action and if a possible collision was to occur, the finch would stop and display a red colour.
